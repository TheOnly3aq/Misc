# Vroom's Miscellaneous Scirpts (VMS)

### This script includes:

- /train to spawn train (ace restricted)
- /lp to lockpick a vehicle (Modified version of [this repo](https://github.com/TwisleOfficial/SimpleLockpick/tree/main))
- /unlock to force unlock a vehicle (ace restricted)
- Engine stall on collison script ([original post](https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-standalone-engine-stalling-on-vehicle-collision/5194284/1))
- /goto command (ace group)
- /bring command (ace group)
- Ped spawner script (original [repo](https://github.com/Fiffers/ped_spawner))

Most of these scripts are made by other people, and some I've made myself. I was tired of having multiple scripts taking up multiple resources so I made it all in one. Hope you enjoy
